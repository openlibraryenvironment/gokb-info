# Guidelines for package names

Package names in GOKB should be unique and distinguishable from other package names. 
For this purpose, the naming scheme is based on the KBART file naming scheme.

The package name should contain:

+ The provider name in a short and understandable form. If the official package name contains the provider name as a component, 
a separate provider name is not necessary (e.g. `Emerald Management 120`).
+ The package name assigned by the provider. If the package contains a complete list of titles from a provider, "All Titles" or "Journals: All Titles" should be added to the name.
+ Add information about regional restriction.
+ Add information for consortia specific packages.
+ Add reference year, if package is not continuously offered.

Name components are separated by a colon followed by a space.

In addition, the characteristics specified in the name should be included in the package properties under the "General" tab in a structured manner, e.g. whether a package is "Regional" with an indication of the region or "Local" with an indication of the organisation.


## Examples package names:

+ `Emerald: Engineering eJournal Collection`
+ `Emerald Management 120` (Emerald as provider name doesn't have to be specified as it is part of the package name)
+ `Brill Journal Archive Online: NL`, **NOT**: `Brill : Brill Journal Archive Online : NL` (the provider Brill ist already part oft he package name; there should be no space before the colon)
+ `Preselect.media: Haufe Erziehungswissenschaften 2020`, **NOT**: `Content Select: Haufe Erziehungswissenschaften 2020` ("Preselect.media" ist the provider oft the platform Content Select)
+ `utb: Transcript Medienwissenschaft 2018`, **NOT**: `Transcript Medienwissenschaft 2018` (utb GmbH ist the platform provider)
+ `Springer Behavioral Science eBooks 2005 English/International` (year is part of the official package name of the provider)
+ `American Chemical Society: hbz` (consortia specific package)
+ `Springer Medicine: Asia-Pacific` (regional restriction)


## Special cases

**Platform change Kohlhammer**

Due to the platform change of the content provider Kohlhammer from "Preselect" to "Kohlhammer eLibrary", the package sections have also changed. The packages with the old Preselect sections are still accessible. These packages can be imported or changed in the GOKB as follows:  
For a clear distinction between the old and new packages from Kohlhammer, the name form should be _package name_ with the addition _[old Preselect package sections]_ (in square brackets).

+ Example: [PÃ¤dagogik 2021_2 [alter Preselect-Paketzuschnitt]](https://gokb.org/gokb-ui/#/package/56333627)

**Package name for national licences**

For licensed packages, the addition is added to the package title: _Provider: Package name: National licence_

+ Example: ProQuest: African Writers Series: National licence
