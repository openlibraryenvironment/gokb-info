## What is a platform?

A platform is a provider's software environment for accessing content, such as journals, 
e-books, or databases. A platform is characterized by:

+ A URL such as http://www.thieme-connect.de (There may be additional 
subdomains such as http://incites.clarivate.com).
+ An optional name (e.g. SpringerLink). For small providers, 
offering only one platform, use the provider name.
