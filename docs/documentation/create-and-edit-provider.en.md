+ You can use the checkboxes at the beginning of the lines to delete data, either by selecting individual lines or by selecting everything via the top checkbox and then pressing the "Delete" button. In the case of the identifiers, trash can icons are also available as a deletion option.

In detail, you can add the following data:

name forms that are not included in the official name form. Name variants that are entered here can be found in the Provider Search.
+ **Identifiers:** Identifiers that describe the provider. Select the "Namespace" 
of the identifier system and enter the identifier value.
+ **Platforms:** Here you can add the platform or platforms offered
  by a provider. Via the button "Add" an existing platform is suggested on the basis of the input
  which you can link to the provider. If none is found on the basis of the name or the URL, a new one will be created and
  linked to the provider.The platform is defined by:
  * **Name:** The platform name. If the provider's platform does not have an official name, you can enter the provider's name or the URL itself here.
  * **URL:** The URL of the platform.
+ **Curatory groups:** Your selected curatory group that will be responsible for maintaining the package will be added automatically.
+ **Contacts:**  E-Mail address of a provider contact such as technical support. 

Once you have added all provider data, select the "Create" or "Update" button at the bottom right.

## What is a platform?

A platform is a provider's software environment for accessing content, such as journals, 
e-books, or databases. A platform is characterized by:

+ A URL such as http://www.thieme-connect.de (There may be additional 
subdomains such as http://incites.clarivate.com).
+ An optional name (e.g. SpringerLink). For small providers, 
offering only one platform, use the provider name.
