## Release 1.8 published
*November 29, 2024*

The current release 1.8, which has been finalised with this update 1.8.2, updates the user interface to the latest version 3 of the Vue framework. Further improvements can be found in the registration, the review requests, the KBART import and the display of curatory groups.

An important new feature is the labelling of the source origin of packages so that it is immediately clear whether a package was imported from the EZB or another repository. In addition, an interface to we:kb has been created to transfer packages from there to the GOKB.

You can find out more about Release 1.8 [here](https://gokb.org/releases.html).

## Release 1.7 published
*January 25, 2024*

The current release 1.7 integrates the DDC classification at title and package level. For journals, the DDC classification is automatically enriched via the German Union Catalogue of Serials (ZDB).

## We mourn the loss of Hans-Jörg Lieder

![Hans-Jörg Lieder](assets/hans_joerg_lieder.jpg "Hans-Jörg Lieder")

We were shocked to learn of the sudden death of our highly esteemed colleague Hans-Jörg Lieder. 
As head of the ZDB he was a key member of the GOKb team and represented us in various contexts 
over the years with great friendliness, humor, competence and serenity. He also provided help 
and advice to his colleagues and was always motivating and supportive.

One memorable event highlighting his thoughtfulness as well as his improvisational skills 
was his participation in the opening event of the WOLFcon 2022 in Hamburg, where he represented 
the GOKb. Thanks to his presence, his many years of experience with overarching issues and 
his engaging personality, he succeeded in turning this panel into a formative exchange on 
the positioning of libraries in a crisis-ridden world.

Just a few weeks ago, Hans-Jörg Lieder was elected to the Board of Directors of the
Open Library Foundation on behalf of the GOKb, a role in which he was looking 
forward to strengthening our project and the German community. We are sure that he would 
have succeeded in doing so.

We will remember him as an outstanding colleague and above all as a warm-hearted 
person and miss him very much. Our special sympathy goes out to his family.

With condolences from his colleagues of the GOKb Moritz Horn, Kirstin Kemner-Heek, 
Maike Osters, Johann Rolschewski, Daniel Rupp, Martina Schildt, Christin Seegert, 
Andrea Stei, Gerald Steilen

## WOLFCon 2022

## New Release 1.2 

*March 18, 2022*

GOKb Release 1.2 has been published. Now you can choose your curatory group to specialize 
in package import or in bibliographic title redaction. Review Request can be escalated to 
another group. Further, KBART validation has been improved. Please find the release notes 
[here](./releases.md "GOKb Release Notes").

## New Release 1.1

*November 18, 2021*

significantly updated and optimised and now run much smoother. The colour 
scheme of the graphic interface was also redesigned. Please find the release 
notes [here](./releases.md "GOKb Release Notes").

## GOKb & Folio: data flow

*October 6, 2021*

In Germany the GOKb has central role for the management of electronic resource packages. 
It provides data to national union catalogues like EZB & ZDB, but also to local library systems like Folio:

![German Folio libraries data flow](assets/gokb-data-flow.png "German Folio libraries data flow")

## New User Interface

*September 1, 2020*

The GOKb has a new user interface! Based on a concept jointly developed with our users 
we have newly coded the interfacec using modern technologies (Vue.js). The main focus of 
this redesign was improved user guidance and the reduction of complexity. The import of 
package data is now realised in four easy steps. Redundant features were eliminated and 
the management of provider and platform data was also streamlined.

The GOKb system running in the background remains the same, so that legacy data will 
be preserved. The old interfaces will from now on not be supported anymore.

## Enhanced Import Client

*May 25, 2020*

The enhanced version of the GOKb import client YGOR is now online at
https://gokb.org/ygor. With this version, a detailed view of each
imported record is shown including feedback on erroneous or problematic
data values and the possibility to correct those manually directly in
the GUI. A saving and loading functionality allows stopping and
continuing the upload process at any time. A manual selection of the
content type of the package (serial or monograph) is no longer
necessary, as this information will be interpreted from the
corresponding KBART fields, so an upload of mixed packages is now
possible. A documentation on how to import and enrich KBART data via the
YGOR client can be found in the GOkb wiki:
<https://openlibraryenvironment.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GOKB/overview>.

## User interface study & pilot phase

*April 15, 2019*

In 2018 a study for a new user interface for GOKb was funded by the
Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (Federal Ministry of
Education and Research). Results were published in April 2019 and will
be implemented within the next year.

Independently of this development, GOKb began a data ingest pilot phase
incorporating 19 German libraries and consortia. The pilot participants
will ingest KBART packages into GOKb and maintain them there. They will
share their experiences and discuss with the editorial staff at regular
conference calls. The pilot phase is open for all institutions. Please
request a GOKb account https://gokbt.gbv.de/gokb/register, and send an
email to info@gokb.org for further information.

## New import client ‘YGOR’

*January 21, 2019*

The North Rhine-Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz) developed a new
GOKb import client: YGOR. YGOR is a multilingual web client which
supports the upload of KBART files to GOKb. With its help journal titles
are automatically compared to the title data of the German Union
Catalogue of Serials (ZDB) and enriched with the ZDB-ID, an identifier
that is utilized by all participating information systems in Germany and
Austria, thereby disambiguating the journal titles. The client no longer
relies on OpenRefine but rather uses the cross referencing API of GOKb.
The prototype is hosted at https://gokbt.gbv.de/ygor/. A [GOKb user
account](mailto:info@gokb.org) for the ingest of data is required.

## GOKb Forum

*May 5, 2018*

GOKb, formerly run by North Carolina State University, has reorganised
as a new coalition of partners. GOKb was formed under the Kuali
Foundation as a sister project of Kuali OLE.GOKb is now a community of
the Open Library Foundation (OLF), along with OLE and FOLIO, among
others. At the GOKb Forum event we will introduce new members of the
project team and their respective backgrounds. We will also inform in
detail about the current activities of the GOKb project team (matching
of data against bibliographic databases, new user interface study,
participation in FOLIO ERM Sub Group).

## GOKb Planning Meeting 2017

*July 1, 2017*

The international GOKb partner institutions met in Berlin to discuss the
future orientation and organisation of GOKb. The North Rhine-Westphalian
Library Service Centre (hbz), the Head Office of the GBV (VZG), and the
German Union Catalogue of Serials (ZDB) joined the GOKb steering
committee and formally took over the responsibilities of hosting and
further developing GOKb.

## Invitation to Establish the Open Library Foundation Global Open Knowledgebase

*June 1, 2017*

The Open Library Foundation (OLF) invited the Global Open Knowledgebase
(GOKb) to join its community as a project. For this purpose the GOKb
steering committee will establish a Community Charter that describes the
mission, organisation, and activities of the GOKb community.
